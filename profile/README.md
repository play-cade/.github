# Welcome to Cade
Cade is a multiplatform arcade emulation application.

## Goals
The Goals for Cade is to provide a cross platform application implementation of the [RetroCade](https://github.com/retro-cade) project. 

As this is early in the project's life the current goal is to provide a consistent Desktop experience on MacOS, Windows and Linux platforms. Mobile and Web targets will be evaluated as the project matures.

## Supported Platform Libraries
Emulated platforms (known as Platform Libraries in the RetroCade project) will come on line as they hit initial release targets. These can be tracked on the RetroCade [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/retro-cade/projects/1)

Currently RetroCade is targetting the RetroC8 Platform Library (CHIP-8) as a hello world style project and will be the first to be available. Other commercial platform libraries will be worked on after this.

## Getting involved
If you would like to get involved with either Cade's development or bringing new platform libraries please reach out on the discussion tabs at either project's Github organisations. More information will be provides as these project mature.
